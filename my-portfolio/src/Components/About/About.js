      With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Science and a background working in a laboratory  as a Scientist.
      I have now pivoted my career towards Software Development. As much as I loved having a role that made a difference,
      I felt extremely under stimulated and wanted a more challenging role. When I came across the world of technology it 
      blew my mind and I was inspired by the fact that complex real world problems could be solved with logic and code.

      I was confident this was the challenge I was searching for and took the leap by leaving my graduate role and joining the 
      School of Code. A full-time 16 week intensive bootcamp which aids in the learning of Fullstack software development including 
      technologies such as Javascript, React, NodeJS, SQL and so much more. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Through this experience I have learnt the importance of pair programming, reading documentation and pushing myself. 
      I am deeply interested in continuing to expand my knowledge while collaborating and solving practical problems.
